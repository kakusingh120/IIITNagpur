                                        A Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science Engineering (Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning) is one of the most prestigious degrees available in this decade. The goal of the course is to build a solid foundation by using the ideas and technology of Artificial Intelligence, which include logic, knowledge representation, probabilistic models, and machine learning.

                                        While artificial intelligence aims to simulate human intellect and behaviour, machine learning is a subset of AI that allows a computer system to make predictions or make judgments based on previous data without having to be explicitly programmed.

                                        Students will learn how to analyse, create, and build knowledge-based and expert systems, as well as Artificial Life and robots, and systems that employ neural networks.
                                        
                                        According to study, roughly 30% of all B2B organisations will use artificial intelligence to improve at least one of their sales processes. This shines light on a critical facet of this field: the market's job requirement. In relative to other traditional engineering professions, a B. Tech. in the subject should yield substantially larger returns.

                                        Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is a multidimensional subject of study that focuses on the design of computer technology, specifically the interaction and interface between humans (users) and devices and systems that include or embed computing. HCI researches how people use technology artefacts as well as how those artefacts may be made to make them easier to use. To better understand and enhance the design, implementation, application, analysis, and assessment of interactive systems, computer scientists engage with specialists in engineering, psychology, linguistics, and social and system organisation in HCI research.

                                        Computer games have progressed beyond their roots as amusement. Educational games, therapeutic games, simulation games, and gamification of utilitarian applications have all been used by researchers and practitioners in novel ways. Individuals and society gain from gaming researchers producing games and using gaming ideas. In the study of games, human-computer interaction (HCI) is crucial. HCI specialists aid in the design and development of better games by evaluating user characteristics, interactions during gaming, and behavioural consequences of gameplay.
